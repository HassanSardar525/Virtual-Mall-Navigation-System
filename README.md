# Virtual-Mall-Navigation-System
A C++ program simulating a virtual mall environment. This system allows dynamic management of shops, customer queuing, and finding the shortest path between shops using Dijkstra's algorithm. It features:

✅ Shop creation, display, and deletion using a linked list

🛒 Customer queue management per shop

📍 Path creation between shops

🚀 Shortest path calculation using Dijkstra’s algorithm

🧭 Interactive menu-driven interface

Perfect for practicing data structures like linked lists, queues, graphs, and algorithms in a real-world mall scenario
